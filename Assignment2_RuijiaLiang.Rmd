# Preparation before analysing

```{r load the data, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide', warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}

  # extract the rows with input species and control treatment
  c_species_data <- raw_data %>% filter(species==species_name,treatment=="control")

  # create an empty data frame, ready for storing values of different statistics
  species_statistics <- data.frame(Species = character(), ctrl.n = numeric(), ctrl.mean=numeric(), ctrl.sd = numeric(), oa.n=numeric(), oa.mean = numeric(), oa.sd = numeric())

# Calculate the log response ratio (lnRR) effect size

Apply the 'escalc' function to calculate the lnRR effext size

```{r lnRR effect size}
# use 'ROM' in measure for the log transformed ratio of means
data <- metafor::escalc(measure = "ROM", 
                        # assign the statistic of CO2 and control to vectors
                        m1i=oa.mean, m2i=ctrl.mean, sd1i=oa.sd, sd2i=ctrl.sd, n1i=oa.n, n2i=ctrl.n, 
                        # use data as the data source
                        data = data, 
                        # define the names
                        var.names = c("lnRR","lnRR_var"))

# quick check
head(data)
```

The warning message shows there are soma NaNs, which needs to be removed.

```{r remove NaNs}
data <- data[complete.cases(data),]
```


Now the data is ready to write out.

```{r write out}
# use 'write_csv' function to write the tibble to a csv file located in the folder of this working directory
write_csv(data, "u7457322_BIOL3207_Assignment2_data.csv")
```


# Model fitted to the data

Make a extra column to the data in order to add the random effect of observation

```{r add obs}
# add in observation-level (residual) column
data$residual <- 1:dim(data)[1]
```


```{r model}
# conduct a multilevel meta-analytic model
MLMA <- metafor::rma.mv(yi = lnRR~1, V = lnRR_var, random=list(~1|Study, ~1|residual), method = "REML", test = "t", dfs = "contain", data=data)
MLMA
```



# Interpretation

Measure the heterogeneity in effect size estimates across studies.

```{r I^2}
# calculate I^2 by i2_ml function
i2_result <- orchaRd::i2_ml(MLMA,data = data)

# make a tibble
i2_tibble <- tibble(type = firstup(gsub("I2_", "", names(i2_result))), I2 = i2_result)
# construct a well format
flextable(i2_tibble) %>%
    align(part = "header", align = "center") %>%
    compose(part = "header", j = 1, value = as_paragraph(as_b("Type"))) %>%
    compose(part = "header", j = 2, value = as_paragraph(as_b("I"), as_b(as_sup("2")),
        as_b("(%)")))
```



```{r prediction intervals}
pd_MLMA <- predict(MLMA)
pd_MLMA
```


Make a forest plot to visualize the statistic values.

```{r forest-plot, fig.cap="Orchard plot showing the mean lnRR and k is the number of effect sizes and the number of studies are in brackets."}
# make the plot using orchard_plot function
# mod = "1" indicates for intercept only model
# N to specify the sample size
forest_1 <- orchaRd::orchard_plot(MLMA, mod = "1", group = "Study", data = data, xlab = "the log response ratio (lnRR)", angle = 45, N = "Average.n")
forest_1
```


Based on the examination and the plot, we can derive the following arguments:

+ The MLMA model constructed above suggested that, on average, across all the species, for every 1 unit increase in the acidification, fish activity would increase by `r coef(MLMA)` unit.

+ Figure \@ref(fig:forest-plot) well supported the outcome of the MLMA model. In Figure \@ref(fig:forest-plot), the mean estimate is shown as the black dot located near the vertical dash line, suggesting that the mean is close to 0.

+ The MLMA model showed 95% confidence interval is between `r MLMA$ci.lb` to `r MLMA$ci.ub`. That is to say, 95% of the time we would expect the true mean to fall between `r MLMA$ci.lb` to `r MLMA$ci.ub`. It is also reasonable to say that if the experiment were repeated many many times, 95% of the confidence intervals constructed would contain the true meta-analytic mean. 

+ The prediction intervals are used to quantify the heterogeneity. The MLMA model indicated a significant amount of heterogeneity among effects (Q = `r MLMA$QE`, df = 794, p = <0.001), with effect sizes expected to be as low as `r pd_MLMA$pi.lb` to as high as `r pd_MLMA$pi.ub`.

+ The $I^2$ estimates reveal the proportion of total heterogeneity. *I<sup>2</sup>*total from the multilevel meta-analytic model is 100%, suggesting that we got highly heterogeneous effect size data as the sampling variation only contributes to almost 0% of the total variation in effects, at least this is what is shown by the *I<sup>2</sup>*total = `r i2_result[1]`. Only `r i2_result[2]` of the total variation in effect size estimates is the result of differences between studies, while residuals contributed `r i2_result[3]` to the variation.


# Funnel plot

Funnel plots are mainly used to observe whether there are various biases in the results of meta-analysis, such as publication bias or other biases. The funnel plot can be used to visually assess whether the study is biased or not.

Here it is made to visually assess the possibility of publication bias.

```{r funnel-plot-1, fig.cap=""}
# make the funnel plot by 'funnel' function
funnel_1 <- metafor::funnel(x = data$lnRR, vi = data$lnRR_var, yaxis = "seinv",
                            # specify the number of decimal places to which the tick mark labels of the x- and y-axis should be rounded.
                            digits = 2, 
                            # specify the level of the pseudo confidence interval region
                            level = c(0.1, 0.05, 0.01), 
                            # specify the color to use for shading the pseudo confidence interval region and the color to use for the points
                            shade = c("white", "gray", "darkgray"),col = "slateblue4",
                            las = 1, 
                            xlab = "the log response ratio (lnRR)",  
                            # specify the y-axis limits
                            ylim=c(1:7,by=2),
                            # specify the location of the vertical ‘reference’ line
                            refline=0, 
                            # add the legend
                            legend = TRUE)
```


Based on Figure \@ref(fig:funnel-plot-1), we can derive the following arguments:

+ 
Missing corners can occur if there is publication bias, such as when some negative results are not published



# Time-lag plot

Time-lag plot is to assess how effect sizes may or may not have changed through time.

```{r timelag-plot-1, fig.cap="Plot of lnRR as a function of publication year. Points are scaled in relation to their precision (1/sqrt(lnRR_var)). Small points indicate effects with low precision or high sampling varaince"}
# use online publication year as the data on x axis
timelag_1 <- ggplot(data, aes(y = lnRR, x = Year..online.)) +
  # scale the points in relation to their precision
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, aes(size = 1/sqrt(lnRR_var))) +
  # add the regression line
  geom_smooth(method = lm, col = "red", show.legend = FALSE) + 
  # label the x axis and y axis and the legend
  labs(x = "Publication Year",y = "the log response ratio (lnRR)", size = "Precision (1/SE)") +
  theme_classic()

timelag_1
```


Based on Figure \@ref(fig:timelag-plot-1), we can derive the following arguments:

+ It appears to be a negative and linear relationship with publication year.

+ Earlier year studies have slightly higher sampling variance, which means lower precision.

+ The earlier year studies show higher effect size compared with studies that are done in later years.


# MLMR with year as a moderator for time-lag bias

We can use multilevel meta-regression to quantify time lag bias.

```{r year_MLMR}
year_MLMR <- rma.mv(lnRR ~ Year..online., V = lnRR_var, random = list(~1 | Study, ~1 | residual), test = "t", dfs = "contain", data = data)
summary(year_MLMR)
```


We may also wonder how much variation does time when results were published explain in lnRR.

```{r r2_year_MLMR}
r2_year_MLMR <- orchaRd::r2_ml(year_MLMR)
r2_year_MLMR
```


Based on the results, we can derive the following arguments:

+ `r r2_year_MLMR[1]` indicates how much variation the ‘fixed effects’ or moderators explain in the model.

+ `r r2_year_MLMR[2]` indicates the full model, that accounts for the both the fixed and random effects, explains `r r2_year_MLMR[2]` of variance in effect size.

+ Time-lag explains `r r2_year_MLMR[1]` of the effect size variance.

+ However, linking to Figure \@ref(fig:timelag-plot-1) and the statistical examination, the evidence is not so strong to determine the huge effect of time lag, as it only contributes a little part of variance.
